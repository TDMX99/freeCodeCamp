        <header>Key Concepts</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript has several key concepts that form the foundation of its
          functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Variables:</strong> Learn how to declare and use variables
            to store and manipulate data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functions:</strong> Explore the power of functions for
            organizing and reusing code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Objects:</strong> Understand the concept of objects and how
            they allow you to structure data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Control Flow:</strong> Master control flow statements like
            if, else, and loops for efficient program execution.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          JavaScript supports various data types, including strings, numbers,
          boolean, null, undefined, and objects. Understanding these data types
          is fundamental for effective programming in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables in JavaScript can be declared using the keywords `var`,
          `let`, or `const`. Each has its own scope and use cases. It's
          important to choose the right type of variable depending on your
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, allowing you to pass
          them as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them
          to variables. This flexibility makes JavaScript a powerful language
          for functional programming.
        </p>
        <code
          >const greeting = function(name) { return `Hello, ${name}!`; }; //
          Example usage const result = greeting('John'); console.log(result); //
          Output: Hello, John!</code
        >

            to pass parameters and return values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Arrays and Objects:</strong> Discover how to work with
            arrays and objects to organize and manipulate data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          JavaScript syntax is similar to other C-style languages, making it
          accessible for developers familiar with languages like Java or C++.
          However, it has its unique features and quirks that add to its
          flexibility and versatility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operators in JavaScript allow you to perform various operations on
          variables and values. From basic arithmetic to bitwise and logical
          operations, understanding operators is crucial for writing efficient
          and error-free code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arrays and objects are fundamental data structures in JavaScript.
          Learn how to create, manipulate, and iterate over arrays. Understand
          the key-value pairs in objects and their use in representing complex
          data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of variables, operators, functions, arrays, and
          objects forms the building blocks of JavaScript programming. Mastering
          these basics is essential for becoming proficient in the language.
        </p>
        <code
          >const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const doubledNumbers =
          numbers.map(num => num * 2); console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output:
          [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Explore the power and flexibility of functions in JavaScript. Learn
          how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values. Understand
          the concept of scope and closures for effective function usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions in JavaScript can be declared using the `function` keyword
          or expressed as anonymous functions. They play a crucial role in
          organizing code, promoting reusability, and implementing modular
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parameters allow you to pass values into functions, making them
          dynamic and adaptable to different scenarios. Functions can also
          return values, enabling you to encapsulate logic and produce results
          for further computation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scope defines the visibility and accessibility of variables within a
          program. JavaScript has function scope, block scope (with `let` and
          `const`), and global scope. Understanding scope is essential for
          avoiding variable conflicts and writing maintainable code.
        </p>
        <code
          >function addNumbers(a, b) { return a + b; } // Example usage const
          sum = addNumbers(3, 7); console.log(sum); // Output: 10</code

          Learn how to create and manipulate objects, work with strings,
          numbers, and other primitive data types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, allowing you
          to represent complex entities. Understand how to create objects,
          access their properties, and leverage object-oriented programming
          concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          String manipulation is a common task in JavaScript. Explore methods
          for working with strings, including concatenation, substring
          extraction, and searching. Mastering string operations is crucial for
          handling textual data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numbers in JavaScript include integers and floating-point values.
          Learn about mathematical operations, rounding, and converting between
          different numeric representations. Precision and accuracy are
          important considerations when working with numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boolean values represent true or false conditions. They play a vital
          role in control flow and decision-making. Explore logical operators
          and conditional statements for effective handling of boolean values.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript also has special data types like `null` and `undefined`.
          Understanding their meanings and use cases is essential for writing
          robust and bug-free code.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of objects and various data types provides the
          foundation for building diverse and sophisticated applications in
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <code
          >const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 30, isStudent: false }; //
          Accessing object properties console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
          // String manipulation const greeting = 'Hello'; const name = 'World';
          const message = `${greeting}, ${name}!`; console.log(message); //
          Output: Hello, World!</code

        <p>
          Master control flow statements in JavaScript to control the flow of
          your programs. Understand the use of conditional statements, loops,
          and other control structures for effective program execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditional statements, such as `if`, `else if`, and `else`, allow you
          to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. Learn how
          to structure your logic to handle different scenarios and ensure the
          desired outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loops, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while`, enable repetitive
          execution of code. Explore how to iterate over arrays, objects, or
          perform a specific number of iterations. Efficiently using loops is
          key to automating tasks and processing data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Switch statements provide an alternative to multiple `if` conditions.
          Understand how to use switch statements for more concise and readable
          code when dealing with multiple possible values.
        </p>
        <p>
